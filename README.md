My cute little .dot files
=========================
This is a repository to keep track of, backup and share my dotfiles!
The majority of these dotfiles are in tandom with the following applications
- Zsh
- Oh My Zsh
- XMonad
- XMobar
- Vim

-----
Usage
-----
Run symlink.sh to symlink all of these files into your home directory (assuming this folder is ~/.dotfiles)
